# Machine Learning Framework

Today, in order to developers save time and money, many projects use packages like tensorflow and pytorch in order to implement neural networks. These packages make it easy for advanced techniques like dense networks, convolutional networks, and descent optimizers to be implemented but they hide the details of how these techniques actually work. The purpose of this project is to build an equivalent machine learning framework from less abstract packages, like numpy and pandas, in order to showcase my knowledge of the machine learning field. 

This project also fits a convolutional neural network to the MNIST dataset using this framework to showcase its functionality. Due to the size of the training and testing files however, the actual datasets must be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) and placed into the project directory.
